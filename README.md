# TrustVault

TrustVault is a blockchain-based document verification and property registry system that leverages Ethereum smart contracts for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record-keeping.

![TrustVault Platform](https://github.com/zs0c131y/TrustVault/blob/main/public/assets/trustland.png)

## 📋 Overview

TrustVault provides a comprehensive solution for:

- **Property Registration & Verification**: Digitally register property details with blockchain-backed verification
- **Property Ownership Transfer**: Securely transfer property ownership with blockchain records
- **Document Verification**: Authenticate and store important documents with cryptographic proof
- **Government Integration**: Dedicated portal for government officials to verify and process requests

The system combines traditional database storage with blockchain verification to create a hybrid architecture that benefits from the security of blockchain while maintaining the performance and flexibility of traditional systems.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
TrustVault utilizes two main Ethereum smart contracts:

1. **PropertyRegistry.sol**: Handles property registration, verification, and ownership transfers
2. **DocumentVerification.sol**: Manages document verification, revocation, and updates

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express**: RESTful API server
- **MongoDB**: Primary database for storing user data and transaction records
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage system

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Client-side implementation
- **Web3.js**: Ethereum blockchain interaction
- **Firebase Authentication**: User authentication system

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting protection
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Helmet security headers
- Input sanitization
- Secure file handling

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ and npm
- MongoDB
- Hardhat
- IPFS daemon (optional for local development)
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zs0c131y/TrustVault.git
   cd TrustVault
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**
   Copy the example environment file and modify it with your values:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB**
   Update MongoDB connection URI in your `.env` file.

5. **Compile and deploy smart contracts**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

6. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Start all services concurrently
   npm run dev
   
   # Or start services individually
   npm run backend  # Start Express server
   npm run hardhat  # Start local Ethereum node
   npm run ipfs     # Start IPFS daemon
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### User Workflows

1. **Property Registration**
   - Navigate to the property registration page
   - Fill in property details and upload required documents
   - Submit the registration request
   - Track the verification status
   - Receive blockchain verification once approved

2. **Document Verification**
   - Go to the document verification section
   - Upload the document and provide required information
   - Submit for verification
   - Track the verification process
   - Access verified documents with blockchain proof

3. **Property Transfer**
   - Select a registered property
   - Enter new owner details
   - Complete the transfer process
   - Verification by government officials
   - Blockchain record update

### Government Official Workflow

1. **Request Verification**
   - Login to government dashboard
   - View pending requests
   - Verify document authenticity
   - Approve or reject requests
   - Monitor verification metrics

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Document hashes rather than actual content are stored on the blockchain
- JWTs have limited lifetime and secure storage
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Input sanitization prevents injection attacks
- Document access is restricted by ownership
- Multi-level verification workflow
